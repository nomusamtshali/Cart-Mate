## **Build a Mobile App with Firebase Project**

### Overview
In this project I built a simpliified functional mobile app with firebase focusing on CSS and Javascript. This included various CSS and Javascript techniques to achieve a fully functional mobile app. The app also utilizes Firebase Realtime Database to store and synchronize data in real-time.

#### Challenges Faced
I struggled mostly with fetching database items in realtime using 'onValue'. I also struggled with removing an item when it was clicked. Favicons also gave me a problem! Integrating Firebase on a project with CSS and JavaScript required careful planning and implementation. I had to understand how to properly configure Firebase services, set up authentication, and manage real-time data synchronization which added complexity to the process of building my app.

Despite these challenges, overcoming them was a rewarding experience that contributed to the improvement of my skills. Through perseverance and with the help of my mates, I was able to successfully navigate the complexities of building a mobile app with Firebase using CSS and JavaScript.

#### Overall Learning Experience
My learning experience on building a mobile app with Firebase using CSS and JavaScript, I can say it was both challenging and rewarding. Throughout the development process, I encountered a few problems, learned new concepts, and improved my skills. Debugging a code was quite frustrating but it strengthened my problem-solving skills. 

In conclusion, building a mobile app with Firebase using CSS and JavaScript was a transformative experience.
